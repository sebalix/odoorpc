Welcome to OdooRPC's documentation!
===================================

Introduction
------------

**OdooRPC** is a Python package providing an easy way to
pilot your `Odoo <https://www.odoo.com>`_ servers through `RPC`.

Features supported:
    - access to all data model methods (even ``browse``) with an API similar
      to the server-side API,
    - use named parameters with model methods,
    - user context automatically sent providing support for
      internationalization,
    - browse records,
    - execute workflows,
    - manage databases,
    - reports downloading,
    - JSON-RPC protocol (SSL supported),

Quick start
-----------

How does it work? See below::

    import odoorpc

    # Prepare the connection to the server
    odoo = odoorpc.ODOO('localhost', port=8069)

    # Check available databases
    print(odoo.db.list())

    # Login
    odoo.login('db_name', 'user', 'passwd')

    # Current user
    user = odoo.env.user
    print(user.name)            # name of the user connected
    print(user.company_id.name) # the name of its company

    # Simple 'raw' query
    user_data = odoo.execute('res.users', 'read', [user.id])
    print(user_data)

    # Use all methods of a model
    if 'sale.order' in odoo.env:
        Order = odoo.env['sale.order']
        order_ids = Order.search([])
        for order in Order.browse(order_ids):
            print(order.name)
            products = [line.product_id.name for line in order.order_line]
            print(products)

    # Update data through a record
    user.name = "Brian Jones"
